1.Why must we choose you?
my self being a really smart working and curious person will definitely take this club to a new level with mine and my-team-mate's contribution to the world of open source  .
i have a really deep thirst for knowledge and contribution to open souce and i belive that if i get into 'amfoss' it would be really great for me to discover and learn enigmatic concepts.

2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?
i have recently enrolled into a web development program run by intershala,furtheron i also do have plan's to learn things like app development,linux,DS and algo,git and github(which i am currently from youtube)
and the most important thing "contribute to a open source projects and get into GSOC".so,this is my plan and will be no matter if i get into amfoss or not(no offense).

3.How would you contribute back to the club?
to be fair i have no idea but some things which i would do are 
1.mentoring the upcoming members to this club 
2.providing a clear guide to team-mates and juniorss about how we can contribute to open source and help them with their ideas 
3.i do love teaching(kind of sharing knowldege ) and i hope i will be in a position to teache my friends and team-mates who ever are willing to learn any concept from me
4.bringig this club to a more prominent position...which goes without saying

4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
since i have no idea avout the selection process i would not like to comment on it.i just hope that you people do given fair opportunity to people who are interested in this
club but have a really less prior knowldege of open source development and programing kind of stuff.
