1.Why must we choose you?

My self being a really smart working and curious person will definitely take this club to a new level, with mine and my-team-mate's contribution to the world of open source.
i have a really deep thirst for knowledge and contribution to open source.I belive that if i do get into 'amfoss' it would be really great for me to discover and learn enigmatic concepts.I will will prove myself to be a really worthy member for amfoss club.

2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?

i have recently enrolled into a web development program run by intershala,furtheron i also do have plan's to learn things like app development,linux,DS and algo,git and github(which i am currently from youtube). The most important thing which i want to do is  "contribute to a open source projects and get into GSOC".
so,this is my plan and will be no matter if i get into amfoss or not(no offense).

3.How would you contribute back to the club?

To be super fair i have no idea but some things which i would do are. 
1.Mentoring the upcoming members to this club 
2.Providing a clear guide to team-mates and juniorss about how we can contribute to open source and help them with their ideas 
3.I do love teaching( sharing knowldege ) and i hope i will be in a position to teache my friends and team-mates who ever are willing to learn any concept from me
4.Bringig this club to a more prominent position...which goes without saying

4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

since i have no idea about the selection process i would not like to comment on it.I just hope that you people do given fair opportunity to people who are interested in this
club but have a really less prior knowldege of open source development and programing kind of stuff.
