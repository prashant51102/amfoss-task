THE FIRST 10 POINTS COVER AN OVERVIEW OF MY JOURNEY "INSTALLING UBUNTU" if you want to read in a little detail about the procedure and steps of intallation process please do visit my site link given at bottom of this file.

1.downloaded ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

2.downloaded rufus3.1 portable version to create a bootable device 

3.watched a youtube video on creating a bootable usb device....and also read an article about the same somewhere on ubuntu page

4.created a iso backup for my laptop if in case anything goes wrong (this thing just saved my laptop twice...you will know why just keep on reading )

5.after that i had to disable secure boot and fast boot in my laptop,also changed the boot order in UFEI seetings(in this process i came to know that BIOS is replaced by UFEI which i more powerful than BIOS and did also watched youtube video of techquickie expalining limitations of BIOS and advatage of UFEI over BIOS)

6.now i plugged the bootable usb containing ubuntu and started installing it

7.the first installation freezed and i had to do it again,the same problem occured for 3 time, after going through some articles on internet  i chose "safe graphics" mode to intall ubuntu

8.this time the installation was succesful to the ubuntu-os was corrupt...left the task (actually the pendrive was broken and i was doubting my self..funny na?)

9.tried it again after a week and installed ubuntu through custom partition method on an external HDD disk (again learned how to install through custom partition from  https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/ )

10.hey thats it...it was a really tedious journey just coz of the faulty pendrive but the final result did gave me really immense satisfaction and joy
