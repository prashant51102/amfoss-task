Nickname:prashanth. 
first i had to register my self into irccloude which i came to know only after 4 days of completiing the task...
This task was preety easy and did complete in just few minutes. 
out of curiosity i also read an article from- https://opensource.com/article/16/6/getting-started-irc 
which gave a approximate understanding of what IRC networks is and why people like it and its some basic features
