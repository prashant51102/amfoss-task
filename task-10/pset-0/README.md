scratch was preety use to use but still it took me around 7 days to create the game.

for reference i did also looked "oscartime" game which was showed in cs50 video lecture .

baby steps was the key,intially i just made a game where  there was only a fish and a oceanic background.then after that slowly added new attributes like mouse controls,score,etc
the only difficulty i faced was overcoming the fear that "i cant make a really cool game" which did tensed me a little bit but eventually as i procceded everything became really easy
and currently i feel like i have mastered scratch.
