this task was really teadious for me...i had no experience solving this kind of problem 

took help through stack-exhange to solve my quries and also found an answer for this question(dint copy just learned how it works and tried to implement the same by myself)

to be fair i was stuck with the syntax and large looking answers(but got used  to it as i moved further on programing in cs50 ide)
